Tab Band calc
- added the iteration of calculations over band sets entering in the first line forbandsets e.g. forbandsets[1:3] for iterating over a range or forbandsets[1,2,3] for iterating selected band sets; it is possible to enter a string after ] to filter names of first band in band set (e.g. forbandsets[1,2,3]RT)
- added the iteration of calculations over dates (format yyyy-mm-dd) of band sets entering in the first line forbsdates e.g. forbsdates[2020-01-01:2020-03-30] for iterating over a range or forbsdates[2020-02-01,2020-03-11,2020-04-21] for iterating selected dates, also list of ranges such as forbsdates[2010-01-01:2010-03-30, 2010-08-01:2010-08-31, 2010-10-01:2010-12-31]; it is possible to enter a string after ] to filter names of first band in band set
- added the iteration of bands in a band set or a range of band sets entering in the first line forbandsinbandset (e.g. forbandsinbandset[1] for iterating over bands in the first band set) and in the following expression the variable #BAND# to refer to the iterated band (e.g. where("#BAND#">1, 1, 2) @"#BAND#")
- added the possibility to use the output name of calculation as variable for following calculations
- added the possibility to add the calculation result to a band set using the %number in the output name such as @output%1 or to current band set with # such as @output%#
- added the possibility to set the output path defining the output name with this structure @path@name, also with the variable #BANDSET# such as @#BANDSET#@name to save the calculation in the directory containing the first band of the current band set. It is recommended to avoid the use of characters # and @ in the raster name
- added the possibility to create temporary output defining the output path (i.e. temp) and output name with this structure @temp@name
- added the option to create virtual raster output (i.e. .vrt files) made of .tif files from parallel processing
- added the variable "bandset#b*" for using all the bands of active band set in expressions such as np.max("bandset#b*")
- added the variable "bandsetNb*" for using all the bands of band set N in expressions such as np.max("bandset1b*")
- added the variable "bandsetNbL" for referring to band set N and Band L in expressions such as "bandset1b1"
- added the variable "bandset*bL" for using the L band of all the band sets in expressions such as np.max("bandset*b1")
- added the variable "bandset{date}bL" for using the L band of all the band sets in the list of dates or range of dates e.g. median("bandset{2019-01-01,2019-03-30}b1") 
- added table filter for band names
- added the possibility to enter !function! followed by an expression of Batch to execute a function using raster names (also previous output names) in the command and the variables !directory! and !file! to refer to the output directory (defined after Run) and relative output file name (defined with @ after the command) respectively e.g. !function!  stack_raster_bands;band_set : 1;output_raster_path : '!directory!' ; it is required to use section character $ instead of apostrophe ' and !! instead of ; for functions ' e.g. !function! add_raster!!input_raster_name : $#NIR#$!!band_set : 1
- added the option to select output raster type as Float32, Int32, Int16, UInt32, UInt16, Byte
- added settings for output nodata value
- added settings for scale and offset values directly in the output .tif file
- the option Input NoData as value allows for using NoData values as regular values
- the option Use NoData value allows for defining a regular value to be used as NoData during calculation

Tab Download products
- the Sentinel-2 search works also without search coordinates if a string is entered in Advanced search (e.g. 33TTG)
- Sentinel-2 level 2A can be filtered entering S2A_MSIL2A* in Advanced search
- Sentinel-2 are downloaded also from Google public service https://storage.googleapis.com/gcp-public-data-sentinel-2

Tab Preprocessing Landsat
- tha panchromatic band is preprocessed only if pansharpening is checked

Tab Preprocessing Sentinel-2
- added checkbox for processing also bands 1, 9, 10
- if Add bands in a new band set is checked an existing empty band set is used first

Tab Band set

- added table filter for band names
- added Sentinel-2 list with all the bands

Tab Batch
- added function qgis_processing to access QGIS Processing tools (e.g. qgis_processing;command : 'grass7:v.dissolve';parameters : 'input': 'input_path', 'column': 'cat','output': 'output_path')
- added function !for_directory_in! to iterate commands for all the directories in a directory path (e.g. !for_directory_in!;'directoryPath') with the variables !directory_name! to use the current directory name and !directory! to use the current directory path. The commands are performed in batch until the command !end_for_directory! . Optionally a directory level and a name filter can be set (e.g. !for_directory_in!;'directoryPath';2;'name'). Multiple name filters can be set with | (e.g. !for_directory_in!;'directoryPath';2;'name1|name2'). It is possible to filter by date if the name ends with the date format yyyy-mm-dd using a range (e.g. 2020-01-01:2020-03-31)
- added function !for_file_in!;directoryPath to iterate commands for all the files (calling !file! in a command) in a directoryPath until !end_for_file! . Optionally a directory level and a file filter (e.g. !for_file_in!;'directoryPath';0;'jpg'). Multiple name filters can be set with | (e.g. !for_file_in!;'directoryPath';0;'jpg|tif'). It is possible to filter by date if the name ends with the date format yyyy-mm-dd using a range (e.g. 2020-01-01:2020-03-31). Also !file_directory! can be used to refer to the parent directory of the file
- added function '!start_for_band_set!';bandsetNumber to iterate commands for all the band sets (calling '!band_set!' in a command) until !end_for_band_set! . It is possible to enter a list of numbers (separated by commas), a range separated by colon, or a list of ranges (e.g. !start_for_band_set!;'2:3' add_new_bandset;band_set : !band_set! !end_for_band_set!
- added the function !temp_raster_#! (replacing # with a number or string e.g. !temp_raster_1!) to create a temporary raster to be used with other functions such as band_calc;expression : '"raster1"';output_raster_path : '!temp_raster_1!'. !temp_raster_1! replaces the path to the raster and temp_raster_1 is the actual name of the raster
- added the possibility to create custom variables entering a line such as !customName! = value (value can be either number or text), for instance !number! = 20, this variable !number! will be replaced in the following parts of the batch script
- added the function remove_band_from_bandset to remove bands from a band set (e.g. remove_band_from_bandset;band_set : 1;band_list : '1, 2')
- the function to create band set accepts a directory and a file name filter as raster_path_list option (e.g. '/dir, tif')
- the function to create band set accepts the satellite name as center_wavelength option to set the band wavelength center
- the function add_raster allows to add the raster to an existing band set (band_set) and optionally set the wavelength (center_wavelength)
- if using Band calc function, it is required to use section character $ instead of apostrophe ' and !! instead of ; for functions expressions

Tab Reclassification
- added new button Incremental new value for calculating a new unique value for every old value

Tab Settings
- added option to create RGB composite of band set when a project is loaded
- added option for using multiple CPU threads (it is recommended to set a value lower than the number of available CPUs)
